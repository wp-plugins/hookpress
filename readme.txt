HookPress turns all of your WordPress-internal hooks into webhooks. Possible uses include generating push notifications or using non-PHP web technology to extend WordPress.

== Description ==

Webhooks are a simple paradigm for developing instant notifications and mashups based on simple HTTP requests. With HookPress you can set up webhooks so that a specified URL (a public service or something you set up) is requested when certain WordPress actions occur. Possible uses include generating push notifications or using non-PHP web technology to extend WordPress.

**To learn about the various hooks WordPress provides**, please consult the WordPress Plugin API's [Action Reference](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference). HookPress currently only supports turning WordPress actions into webhooks... filter support is planned.

**To learn more about webhooks**, take a look at [the webhooks blog](http://blog.webhooks.org) as well as [The Pushbutton Web](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/07/the-pushbutton-web-realtime-becomes-real.html) by Anil Dash. Webhooks champion Jeff Lindsay's [excellent slides](http://www.slideshare.net/progrium/using-web-hooks) are a particularly good place to start.

**To write and host a target script** you can of course use your own server but you might also consider [Scriptlets](http://www.scriptlets.org/). A dead-simple tool which logs any requests thrown at it, `test.php`, is included with HookPress as a great way to test requests generated by your webhooks.

== Installation ==

Upload the HookPress plugin to your blog's `wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate. In the admin section, go to Settings > Webhooks to add new webhooks.
