HookPress turns all of your WordPress-internal hooks into webhooks. Possible uses include generating push notifications or using non-PHP web technology to extend WordPress.

== Description ==

Webhooks are a simple paradigm for developing instant notifications and mashups based on simple HTTP requests. With HookPress you can set up webhooks so that a specified URL (a public service or something you set up) is requested when certain WordPress actions occur. Possible uses include generating push notifications or using non-PHP web technology to extend WordPress.

<b>To learn about the various hooks WordPress provides</b>, please consult the WordPress Plugin API's <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference'>Action Reference</a>. HookPress currently only supports turning WordPress actions into webhooks... filter support is planned. <a href='http://wphooks.flatearth.org/'>WP Hooks</a> is also a good resource.

<b>To learn more about webhooks</b>, take a look at <a href='http://blog.webhooks.org'>the webhooks blog</a> as well as <a href='http://dashes.com/anil/2009/07/the-pushbutton-web-realtime-becomes-real.html'>The Pushbutton Web</a> by Anil Dash. Webhooks champion Jeff Lindsay's <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/progrium/using-web-hooks'>excellent slides</a> are a particularly good place to start.

<b>To write and host a target script</b> you can of course use your own server but you might also consider <a href='http://www.scriptlets.org/'>Scriptlets</a>. A dead-simple tool which logs any requests thrown at it, `test.php`, is included with HookPress as a great way to test requests generated by your webhooks.

== Installation ==

Upload the HookPress plugin to your blog's <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory and activate. In the admin section, go to Settings > Webhooks to add new webhooks.
